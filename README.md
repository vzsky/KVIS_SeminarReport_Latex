# KVIS SeminarReport Latex

This is the KVIS required template for the students' project / seminar submission. The original version, in MS word format, was sent to me, and I rewrote it using latex, maintaining only key features and major requirements.

Why latex? well, equations are handled way easier using latex.

It is possible to ask for the official template in latex from the math department, but it is way different to the MS word one, and to me, ugly.

I can ensure that this one is easier to use (defined functions, auto table of content, figures, and more), and also prettier.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL LATEX SCRIPT FROM KVIS.
USE UNDER YOUR OWN CONSIDERATION. (I used this and there was no problem whatsoever)
